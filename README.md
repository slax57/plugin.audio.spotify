# Unofficial Spotify music plugin for Kodi - Light version

Based on the **unofficial Spotify plugin for Kodi**: https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/plugin.audio.spotify

The main purpose of this fork is to increase performance and stability, for use on slower devices like a Raspi or a Steamlink. It focuses on the following features only:

- Local playback
- Ability to act as a _Spotify Connect_ target
- Performance tweaks

**Disclaimer:** I do not have enough spare time to make this projet ready to use for anyone, nor to provide any support of any kind for this plugin. This is just the result of an experiment that I share for whatever purpose it may serve.


## Installation
To install the add-on, first install **marcelveldt's repo v1.0.2** (for dependencies):
https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/repository.marcelveldt/raw/master/repository.marcelveldt/repository.marcelveldt-1.0.2.zip

Then install **this plugin from the ZIP file** provided in the releases section :
https://github.com/slax57/plugin.audio.spotify/releases


## Features and limitations
This project is to be seen as an experiment. It is still very primitive, and may contain bugs.

Also, this doc needs to be improved.
