# Headless Spotify Connect player Add-on for Kodi

Based on the **unofficial Spotify plugin for Kodi**: https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/plugin.audio.spotify

The main purpose of this fork is to increase performance and stability, by focusing on the only feature I need of this plugin, which is to act as a _Spotify Connect local playback target_.

**Disclaimer:** I do not have enough spare time to make this projet ready to use for anyone, nor to provide any support of any kind for this plugin. This is just the result of an experiment that I share for whatever purpose it may serve.


## Installation
To install the add-on, first install **marcelveldt's repo v1.0.2** (for dependencies):
https://github.com/kodi-community-addons/repository.marcelveldt/raw/master/repository.marcelveldt/repository.marcelveldt-1.0.2.zip

Then install **this plugin from the ZIP file** provided in the releases section :
https://github.com/slax57/plugin.audio.spotify/releases


## Features and limitations
This project is to be seen as an experiment, and is still very primitive.

You can sign in to your Spotify Account from this plugin's settings page, or by using Spotify Connect directly.

All the playback features seem to work okay, except concerning playback's termination (if you hit Stop or change playback target device).

Also, this doc needs to be improved.
